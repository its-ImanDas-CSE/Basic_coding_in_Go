# Basic_coding_in_Go
Here all the basic code is stored, which is needed to learn Go.

1. Created by Google
Go was created by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007 and released publicly in 2009.
It's designed to be simple, fast, and efficient, focusing on easy development of scalable software.
2. Simplicity and Clean Syntax
Go's syntax is simple and easy to read, making it great for beginners.
It eliminates the complex features from other programming languages like inheritance, which makes it easier to learn and use.
3. Compiled Language
Go is a compiled language, which means that Go code is turned into machine code that the computer can execute directly. This makes Go programs run fast.
The compiled binaries are small, and you can distribute a single file for your application without needing an interpreter or runtime environment.
4. Concurrency Support (Goroutines)
Go has built-in support for concurrency, which means it can handle multiple tasks at once.
It uses goroutines (lightweight threads) for concurrent programming, which makes it efficient and fast in handling multiple tasks without slowing down.
5. Garbage Collection
Go has garbage collection, which automatically manages memory by cleaning up unused memory to prevent memory leaks.
This helps developers focus more on writing code and less on manual memory management.
6. Statically Typed
Go is statistically typed, which means the data types of variables (like numbers, strings, etc.) are checked at compile time.
This leads to fewer errors at runtime and makes the code more predictable.
7. Standard Library
Go comes with a powerful standard library, which includes many built-in packages for things like working with files, networking, web servers, and more.
This reduces the need for external libraries and helps speed up development.
8. Cross-Platform
Go supports multiple platforms and can run on various operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
You can compile Go programs for different platforms without needing extra tools or modifications.
9. Fast Execution
Go is known for its fast execution speed because it compiles directly to machine code and has simple, efficient design choices.
It's often used in scenarios that require high performance, like web servers, networking, and cloud computing.
10. Great for Scalability
Go is designed to handle large-scale applications efficiently.
It is widely used in backend development, especially in building high-performance servers, microservices, and cloud-based applications.
In summary, Go is a simple, fast, and powerful programming language that's great for building high-performance and scalable software, especially in the fields of web development, cloud computing, and networking.
